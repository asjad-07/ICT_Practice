 What ICT Means to Me

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is more than just computers and the internet — it’s the bridge that connects people, ideas, and innovations across the world.

For me, ICT means:

Connectivity – staying linked with people and knowledge globally

Innovation – using technology to solve problems and create opportunities

Learning – a powerful tool to explore, share, and grow knowledge

Future – shaping careers, businesses, and everyday life through digital solutions

In short, ICT is the foundation of today’s digital world, and learning it helps me build skills that matter for tomorrow.
